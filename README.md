# AirportMatching

##Â Statement of purpose

The goal of this project is to build a small service consuming rows representing users and their locationn, and matching each of them with the nearest airport.

For the purpose of this demonstration, we will be consuming rows from a CSV file, and printing them
to stdout. In a real-world setting, this service would likely consume a stream (Kafka, Kinesis, RabbitMQ, etc.) and store its results in a storage medium such as a database (for example Cassandra) or
a filesystem.

This exercise only focuses on the part "in-between", where we match every user with an airport.
However, the codebase and the abstractions were crafted with a real-world situation in mind ; thus
why the "Bridge" abstraction was created. [Read more about bridges here](src/main/scala/airportmatching/Bridges/README.md).
